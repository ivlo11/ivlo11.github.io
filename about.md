I am a software engineer who drives sales through innovative solutions for eCommerce applications. My expertise is in enhancing customer experience, improving site responsiveness, problem identification and resolution, project delivery from inception through implementation, and releasing mission-critical changes to production environments.

I have an insatiable desire to learn. I love new, unknown and unconquered projects. I love the feeling of hacking away at something and in the end solving the puzzle, putting all the pieces together and suddenly realizing, youâ€™ve only scratched the surface of how awesome the project could really be. In the words of Voltaire:

>"The more I read, the more I acquire, the more certain I am that I know nothing."

My weapons of choice: Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, JSON, XML, PostgreSQL, Apache Tomcat, Linux, Subversion
