  I love new, unknown and unconquered projects. I love the feeling of 
  hacking away at something and in the end solving the puzzle, putting 
  all the pieces together and suddenly realizing, youâ€™ve only 
  scratched the surface of how awesome the project could really be.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "http://ivlo11.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
